Bugfix
   * In library/net_sockets.c, _POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE are
     defined to specific values.  If the code is used in a context
     where these are already defined, this can result in a compilation
     error.  Instead, assume that if they are defined, the values will
     be adequate to build Mbed TLS.
