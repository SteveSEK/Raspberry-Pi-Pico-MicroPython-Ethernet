Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython Ethernet
======================================

## Overview
This is the MicroPython project, which aims to put an implementation of micropython, WIZnet ethernet chip and raspberry pi pico(RP2040).
And, there are some micoropython examples using it. 

## Major Features (components) based on on **[Micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython)**
* **[RP2040 SDK](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040)**
* **[WIZnet W5100S](https://www.wiznet.io/ko/product-item/w5100s)** (Ethernet Chip MacRaw mode)  (W5500 가능)
* **[lwIP](https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip)**
* **[mbedTLS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls)**
* **[upip](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/packages.html#upip-package-manager)**
 
# Hardware requirements
The W5100S-EVB-Pico is a microcontroller evaluation board based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip and full hardwired TCP/IP controller W5100S chip. 
The W5100S-EVB-Pico has the same role as the Raspberry Pi Pico platform and includes W5100S, so the Ethernet function is basically included.
But in this repo, I used ***W5100S MacRaw mode*** and ***lwIP TCP/IP stack***.
