AWS IoT Core(MQTTS) example
======================================

This example demonstrates implementing AWS IoT Core device for Raspberry PiPico(RP2040) and Micropython using WIZnet W5100S.


## Hardware requirements
The W5100S-EVB-Pico is a microcontroller evaluation board based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip and full hardwired TCP/IP controller W5100S chip. 
The W5100S-EVB-Pico has the same role as the Raspberry Pi Pico platform and includes W5100S, so the Ethernet function is basically included.
But in this repo, I used ***W5100S MacRaw mode*** and ***lwIP TCP/IP stack***.

## Network activation
About network activation, you can refer **[Init Network](documents/init_network.md)**.


## upip install micropython-umqtt.robust
### micropython-umqtt.robust
umqtt is a simple MQTT client for MicroPython. (Note that it uses some MicroPython shortcuts and doesnâ€™t work with CPython). It consists of two submodules: umqtt.simple and umqtt.robust. umqtt.robust is built on top of umqtt.simple and adds auto-reconnect facilities for some of networking errors.

## AWS IoT client certificates
I converted certificate files which I received AWS-IoT-administrator to der format files and uploaded them to the W5100S-EVB-Pico, as below
And, 
```
D:\Work\openssl>openssl x509 -in cert.pem -outform DER -out cert.der
WARNING: can't open config file: /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf

D:\Work\openssl>openssl rsa -in key.pem -outform DER -out key.der
WARNING: can't open config file: /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf
